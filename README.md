# CCNA2-Network-Case-Study
#Update -2025 -This was my first real network for CCNA2 which was in semester 2 of year 2, this was the case study for the end of this course, This had a Grade of A, I could have done better.

My small business network
In this Case Study I configured all the devices for a small network. I configured a router, switch and PCs to support both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity for supported hosts. My router and switch must also be managed securely. I also  configured inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, Etherchannel, and port-security.
