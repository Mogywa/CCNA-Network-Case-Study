# CCNA-Network-Case-Study
My small business network
In this Case Study I configured all the devices for a small network. I configured a router, switch and PCs to support both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity for supported hosts. My router and switch must also be managed securely. I also  configured inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, Etherchannel, and port-security.
